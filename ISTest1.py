The program is made to determine which method of payment is better (pays more $)

First option pays flat $100 per day for 10 days.
Second option pays $1 for the first day and doubles amound each day for 10 days.

option1 will output 100 * 10 days
option2 will loop 10 times, addgit ing to previous total, doubling the amount each time and adding to total

If total amount for each option is equal, output "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same"
If option1 pays better, we output "Option 1 is better"
If option2 pays better, we output "Option 2 is better"
